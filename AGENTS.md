<!-- BAGAKIT:LIVING-KNOWLEDGE:START -->
This is a managed block for `bagakit-living-knowledge`. Do not hand-edit the
managed region directly; refresh it through the skill operator instead.

Resolve the installed skill dir before using the operator directly:

- `export BAGAKIT_LIVING_KNOWLEDGE_SKILL_DIR="<repo-relative-installed-skill-dir>"`

Boot layer:

- Read the resolved `must-guidebook.md` before relying on memory.
- If a task needs shared knowledge rules, read `must-authority.md`.
- If a task needs maintenance-route guidance or shared directives, read `must-sop.md`.
- If a task needs prior decisions or facts, follow `must-recall.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` is only the bootstrap layer; the shared checked-in knowledge root
  defaults to `docs`, with shared path protocol config in
  `.bagakit-knowledge.toml` when present.

Recall discipline:

- Search first:
  - `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_KNOWLEDGE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/bagakit-living-knowledge.sh" recall search --root . '<query>'`
- Then inspect only the needed lines:
  - `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_KNOWLEDGE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/bagakit-living-knowledge.sh" recall get --root . <path> --from <line> --lines <n>`
- Prefer quoting only needed lines over paraphrasing from memory.

Substrate discipline:

- Shared knowledge belongs under the configured shared root.
- `.bagakit/` is host-local runtime state and may be ignored; do not publish
  shared knowledge there.
- Durable examples and managed bootstrap text must stay repo-relative; never
  record absolute filesystem paths in shared knowledge or AGENTS guidance.
- When imported material needs one durable handle, prefer a short opaque id
  such as `k-2ab7qxk9` instead of a timestamped capture name.
- Research runtime belongs to `bagakit-researcher`.
- Task-level composition/runtime belongs to `bagakit-skill-selector`.
- Repository evolution memory belongs to `bagakit-skill-evolver`.
- `living-knowledge` owns path protocol, normalization, indexing, and recall.
- `living-knowledge` also owns generated `must-sop.md` and reusable-items
  governance inside the shared knowledge root.

Inspection helpers:

- View the resolved path protocol:
  - `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_KNOWLEDGE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/bagakit-living-knowledge.sh" paths --root .`
- Refresh the guidebook and helper map:
  - `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_KNOWLEDGE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/bagakit-living-knowledge.sh" index --root .`
- Run non-destructive diagnostics:
  - `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_KNOWLEDGE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/bagakit-living-knowledge.sh" doctor --root .`

If the surrounding workflow explicitly asks for `living-knowledge` task
reporting, the response footer may use:

- `[[BAGAKIT]]`
- `- LivingKnowledge: Surface=<updated shared surfaces or none>; Evidence=<commands/checks>; Next=<one deterministic next action>`

## Engineering Rules

- Read before writing: inspect the files being changed, nearby patterns,
  imports, and relevant tests before editing.
- Match this repository: prefer existing helpers, libraries, naming, layout, and
  test style over introducing a new pattern.
- Keep diffs surgical: change only what the task requires, and clean up only
  artifacts caused by the change.
- Avoid speculative design: add abstractions, configuration, error handling, or
  dependencies only when the current requirement proves they are needed.
- Make success verifiable: turn vague work into concrete behavior and run the
  narrowest meaningful tests or checks.
- Debug by evidence: read the full error, reproduce before fixing, change one
  thing at a time, and avoid workarounds without understanding the cause.
- Explain important decisions: state assumptions, tradeoffs, uncertainty, test
  gaps, and dependency additions clearly.
- Keep commit messages specific when preparing commits.
